<p style="color:#808080;">I AM KATE ASHLEY REVILLES, I AM 19 YEARS OLD WHO IS CURRENTLY IN COLLEGE PURSUING COMPUTER SCIENCE, I AM A VERY TIMID PERSON,
 I KEEP THINGS TO MYSELF AND I GUESS YOU COULD SAY I AM JUST IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE EVERYDAY HUSTLE AND BUSTLE OF LIFE.</p>

<p style="color:#808000;">MY GUIDING PRINCIPLE IN LIFE IS TO ALWAYS BE CONSISTENT IN MY VISIONS AND GOALS IN LIFE DESPITE THE SETBACKS AND HARDSHIPS
 THAT IS WILL FACE IN LIFE, THIS IS BECAUSE AS SOMEONE WHO DREAMS A LOT I HAVE LEARNED THAT GOALS TAKE TIME. I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THEM SOONER
 BUT WITH THE GRACE OF GOD I KNOW I AM ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THEM FOR I HAVE AN ENTIRE LIFETIME.</p>

<p style="color:#A52A2A;">I AM ALIKE TO OTHER PEOPLE WHO DON'T TALK MUCH AND I USUALLY DON'T GIVE OUT AS MUCH OF MY TIME TO THINGS THAT DON'T CONCERN ME,
 A TRAIT OF MINE THAT WOULD MAKE DIFFERENT FROM OTHERS IS I AM VERY SOFTSPOKEN IN PUBLIC BUT IT MOSTLY DEPENDS ON MY MOOD AND THE PEOPLE I AM WITH.</p>

<p style="color:#4863A0;">THESE ACCOMPLISHTMENTS THAT ME AND MY FAMILY ARE PROUD OF ARE, WHEN I WAS ABLE TO GRADUATE SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL WITH HONORS DESPITE
 NEVER BEING AN HONOR STUDENT, I WAS ABLE TO JOIN A SPORT WHICH HELPED ME BOOST MY CONFIDENCE AND I WAS ALSO ABLE TO PASS ALL OF MY SUBJECTS IN THE FIRST SEMESTER
 AND WITH THAT I HAVE ALSO LEARNED TO MANAGE MY TIME.</p>

<p style="color:#800080;">MY PLANS AND DREAMS IS TO HOPEFULLY GRADUATE COLLEGE AND SO THAT IN THE FUTURE I WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP MY FAMILY
 FINANCIALLY AND TO ALSO HELP MYSELF.</p>
